## Configure
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file. These are the available settings.

setting | default | what it affects
------- | ------- | ---------------
`ShowMenuKey` | `i` | The keybind which opens the menu (see [valid key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Key_Bindings)). This supports multi-key bindings.
`AllowProblematicItems` | `false` | Whether to show items which may cause bugs or crashes when spawned.

## FAQs
### What are 'problematic items'?
You can [edit `config.json`](#configure) to enable problematic items, which are normally hidden
because they cause in-game issues, glitches, or crashes. These are the items considered problematic:

item | issue
---- | -----
Crystal Chair | (Unreleased version.) Glitches and causes crashes once rotated / picked up.
Incubator | Can't be removed once placed.
Locked Door | Can't be removed once placed.
Mushroom Box | Can't be removed once placed (unless you install the [Craftable Mushroom Boxes](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2899) mod _before_ spawning them).
Obelisk | Once placed, it runs a glitched animation when the player is near that eventually starts switching between the Obelisk and a chicken statue sprite. Picking it up after that point can cause an immediate game crash or result in an unremovable inventory item.
Wicked Statue | (Lit eyes version.) Can't be removed once placed.
